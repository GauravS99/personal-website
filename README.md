This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


## Deploying Updates

This is more for me to keep track of how to deploy updates.


After making changes, git commit and push them. Then, run:
### `npm run build`
### `npm run deploy`
